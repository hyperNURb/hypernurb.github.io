##### Octane AI
Octane AI is a Facebook Messenger chatbot platform that specializes in ecommerce marketing. My resposibilities were to develop features focused around our Shopify integration and build 3rd party platform integrations. During the time I was there the Octane AI Shopify App was featured by Shopify twice and was also a trending app in their app store.


##### Reciprocity Inc.
I was hired as a subcontractor for an open-source _GGRC_ (Google Governance, Risk and Compliance) project led by Google. One of my primary duties was to improve the current front end architecture and its performance.


##### Rebelmouse
My duties for one of the best and fastest growing social publishing platforms were twofold: as a core developer I developed features, shaped the product and scaled application architecture. As a team lead I delegated tasks, and performed code reviews and technical interviews for newcomers.
We were recognized as one of the best in [Time](http://techland.time.com/2013/05/06/50-best-websites-2013/slide/rebelmouse/) and [BusinessInsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/17-startups-to-quit-your-career-for-2013-10).
