### Work & experience

As a developer with more than 10 years of experience, I have helped startups, small businesses and large enterprises build their websites and applications. I have worked as both a contractor and a full-time employee for a variety of clients and agencies.

##### Reciprocity Inc.
I was hired as a subcontactor for an open-source _GGRC_ (Google Governance, Risk and Compliance) project led by Google. One of my primary duties is to improve the current front end architecture and its performance.


##### Rebelmouse
My duties for one of the best and fastest growing social publishing platforms were twofold: as a core developer I developed features, shaped the product and scaled application architecture. As a team lead I delegated tasks, and performed code reviews and technical interviews for newcomers.
We were recognized as one of the best in [Time](http://techland.time.com/2013/05/06/50-best-websites-2013/slide/rebelmouse/) and [BusinessInsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/17-startups-to-quit-your-career-for-2013-10).


##### Saturized
I joined Saturized, an award-winning design agency, in order to help them provide their clients  with a superior exprience and pixel perfect designs. My duties were to establish and lead a front end development team and standardize their development processes.
